## Background
- TileLink spec
- Noc architecture


## Questions
From S.Takano

"1) Is the TileLink, standard NoC router arhitecture?
There is no description about flit buffers, arbitor, xbar, but supports a burst transmission.
It is just like a port definision (they call as Master/Slave Agent) with a memory map.

2) There is no explanation about interfacing between the TileLink and Processor/Local Memory
Can the agent be the processor core (or its cache memory)?

3) There is no explanation about how memory map affects to the communication.
How connected between TileLink and processor/memory is unknown, I need an example.

4) I want NoC router which supports a load from/store to a local memory in a tile, is this supported?
If not supported, is alternative NoC available for this style?"
